# My interview application @Greenspark

This project is a small full-stack coding challenge based on some requirements and a Figma design. 
You can find the server side of this application at [Greenspark server](https://github.com/vasstekla/greenspark-server).

## React

The ui has a React + Typescript codebase, and it is made to be responsive. 
In order to start the project locally run

`npm i` followed by `npm start`

You should be able to access the page on [Localhost 3000](http://localhost:3000/). If the server is not yet started you will be greeted by an empty widget container. 
Once the server is up aswell (follow the setup at [Greenspark server](https://github.com/vasstekla/greenspark-server)) you will see 3 widgets that can be customized. 

Each functionality mentioned on the Figma should work, including the tooltip (with delayed closure), onHover actions, button functionalities, spacing, color scheme etc. 

**Have fun :)**
